 - **Automated MacOS Releases**: Successfully developed a GitHub Actions workflow for streamlining macOS releases, including artifact handling and release tagging based on version naming conventions.



- **Notarization Step Added**: Incorporated a notarization step into the workflow to comply with Apple's Gatekeeper security requirements before uploading the artifact.



- **Version Management Enhancement**: Improved the use of `$GITHUB_ENV` variables for dynamic versioning, ensuring accurate and consistent version identification across macOS binary releases.



- **Release Tags Streamlined**: Ensured that release tags follow a standardized pattern (e.g., 'screenpipe-macos') derived from `GITHUB_REF_NAME`, simplifying tag management.



- **Release Notes Integration**: Seamlessly integrated the generation and upload of macOS release artifacts, including comprehensive release notes sourced directly from GitHub Actions workflow outputs for better traceability.



- **Version Consistency Enforcement**: Established a verification process to maintain version consistency across different MacOS releases using the repository's release page as a reference point.

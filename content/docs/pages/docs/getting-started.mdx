## 1. Installation Options

### CLI Installation

- **For technical users**: Screenpipe can be installed and used via the command-line interface (CLI).
- **Instructions**:
  1. Clone the repository.
  2. Install dependencies (ensure Rust, Cargo, and any other required tools are installed).
  3. Build the project and run the CLI.

By default, data is stored in `~/.screenpipe` (or `C:\AppData\Users\<user>\.screenpipe` on Windows). This can be customized by using the `--data-dir` flag.

### Desktop App

- **Paid Desktop App**: Offers priority support, 1-year updates, and exclusive features. Users can download and install the desktop app directly from the official site.
- **Free Desktop App**: Open-source and available to build yourself. Installation requires building from the source code or sending a PR to the repository. Both options provide a fully functional desktop application with all key features.

### Manual Build

## 4. Pipe Store & Plugins

Screenpipe includes a **Pipe Store**â€”a marketplace for pipes (plugins) where users can create, share, and install pipelines to extend the functionality of the base tool. Pipes run in a Deno Typescript engine, making it easy to build powerful scripts that interact directly with captured data.

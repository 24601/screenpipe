### What's the difference between Screenpipe and other tools like Adept.ai or Rewind.ai?

<MotionDiv delay={0.3}>

- **Adept.ai** is a closed-source product primarily focused on automation. **Screenpipe**, on the other hand, is open-source and focuses on providing a flexible framework for building a variety of tools and integrations.

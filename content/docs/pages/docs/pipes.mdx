# Pipes and Plugins

<MotionDiv>
  Pipes are an essential part of Screenpipe, providing powerful extensibility through custom workflows that interact with captured screen and audio data. Whether you need to tag activities, generate summaries, or send data to third-party services, pipes allow you to tailor Screenpipe to your specific needs.
</MotionDiv>

## 1. Overview of Pipes

<MotionDiv delay={0.3}>
  Pipes in Screenpipe are plugins designed to process data captured from your screen and audio feeds. They automate workflows such as tagging, summarizing, and integrating data with external platforms like Notion, Salesforce, or Slack.

  ### Key Features of Pipes:
  - **Custom Workflows**: Automate repetitive tasks such as tagging screen activity or summarizing audio transcriptions.
  - **Real-Time Processing**: Pipes can process captured data in real-time.
  - **Integration Capabilities**: Extend the functionality by sending processed data to third-party apps.

  **Example Use Cases**:
  - **AI Activity Tagging**: Automatically tag screen or audio activities based on AI models.
  - **Meeting Summaries**: Generate summaries of meeting discussions using combined screen and audio data.
  - **CRM Integration**: Automatically log interactions or captured data into a CRM like Salesforce.

## 3. Developing Pipes in Screenpipe

<MotionDiv delay={0.7}>
  Screenpipe’s plugin system, known as the **Pipe Store**, enables you to create customized pipes that automate workflows. Pipes can process, annotate, analyze, summarize, or integrate your screen and audio data with other tools.

  **Key Concepts**:
  - **Pipe Example**: screenpipe | AI tag | Notion update
  - **Pipe Example**: screenpipe | AI tag | Slack report
  - **Pipe Example**: screenpipe | Log daily activities

  This makes it possible to create countless workflows based on specific needs, helping automate tedious or complex tasks.

## 4. Running Pipes in Development Mode

<MotionDiv delay={0.9}>
  Developers can test their custom pipes by using the following command to download and run them locally:

  ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:3030/pipes/download" \
       -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
       -d '{"url": "https://github.com/mediar-ai/screenpipe/tree/main/examples/typescript/pipe-stream-ocr-text"}'
  ```

  This command downloads the pipe from the specified URL and installs it for local development and testing.

## 6. What’s Next for Pipes?

<MotionDiv delay={1.3}>
  Screenpipe’s pipe ecosystem is growing rapidly. Here’s what’s coming next for pipes:
  
  - **Dependency Support**: Soon, developers will be able to include third-party libraries in their pipes (e.g., Vercel AI SDK).
  - **Desktop API Access**: Developers will have access to desktop-specific APIs, allowing customization of notifications and app interactions.
  - **Seamless Publishing**: Pipes will soon be easier to publish, similar to the Obsidian store, allowing frictionless sharing and discovery.

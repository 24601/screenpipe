## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

<MotionDiv delay={1.1}>

- Use present tense (e.g., "Add feature", not "Added feature").
- Follow the imperative mood (e.g., "Fix bug", not "Fixes bug").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or fewer.
- After the first line, freely reference issues or pull requests.

### Rust Coding Style

<MotionDiv delay={1.3}>

All Rust code must follow the [official Rust Style Guide](https://github.com/rust-lang/style-team/blob/master/guide/guide.md). Our project structure also adheres to the recommended [Rust project layout](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/project-layout.html).

## Core Development Principles

<MotionDiv delay={1.5}>

- **User-First Mindset**: Prioritize user needs and build features that solve real problems.
- **Concurrency**: Use channels over mutexes and locks whenever possible.
- **Simplicity**: Optimize for less code, fewer dependencies, and simpler designs.
- **Focus**: Stay focused on the core functionalities that provide the most value.
- **Functional Programming**: Prefer functional paradigms over OOP for most cases.
- **Measurement**: Use quantifiable metrics to guide improvement.

## Running the Build and Tests

<MotionDiv delay={1.7}>

Before submitting a pull request, ensure that all tests pass:

1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release --features metal
   ```

2. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   cargo test
   ```

3. For macOS users running Apple native OCR, set the `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`:
   ```bash
   DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(pwd)/screenpipe-vision/lib cargo test
   ```

You can add this environment variable to `.vscode/settings.json` for convenience.

## Additional Resources

<MotionDiv delay={1.9}>

- **Issue Labels**: We use labels like `bug`, `enhancement`, `good first issue`, and `documentation` to help triage issues.
- **Memory Debugging**: For debugging memory leaks, you can use Rust’s sanitizer tools:
   ```bash
   RUSTFLAGS="-Z sanitizer=leak" cargo run --bin screenpipe
   ```

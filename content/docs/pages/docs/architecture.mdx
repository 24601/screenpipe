# Architecture Overview

<MotionDiv>

The architecture of Screenpipe is designed to handle continuous screen and audio capture, local data storage, and real-time processing. Below is a breakdown of the key components and their roles in the system.

## Diagram Overview

A visual diagram shows the architecture's flow:

![Screenpipe Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mediar-ai/screenpipe/main/content/diagram2.png)

1. **Input**: Screen and audio data.
2. **Processing**: OCR, STT, transcription, multimodal integration.
3. **Storage**: SQLite database.
4. **Plugins**: Custom pipes.
5. **Integrations**: Cloud, AI services.

This modular architecture makes Screenpipe highly adaptable to different use cases, ranging from personal productivity tracking to more advanced business intelligence and analytics.

## 1. Data Capture Layer

- **Screen Capture**: Captures video frames from the screen in real-time and stores them in the local filesystem for processing. Supports multi-monitor setups, allowing multiple screen captures simultaneously.
- **Audio Capture**: Captures audio from input (e.g., microphone) and output (e.g., speakers). The captured audio is stored locally and can be transcribed using STT engines like Whisper Distil.
- **24/7 Operation**: Screenpipe is designed to capture data continuously, ensuring no important screen or audio events are missed during active sessions.

## 2. Data Processing Layer

- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**: Applies OCR to captured video frames to extract text. This allows for searching and retrieving specific information from screenshots.
- **Speech-to-Text (STT)**: Converts captured audio into transcriptions. The transcriptions can be used for generating meeting summaries, live captions, or language translations.
- **Multimodal Processing**: Combines screen and audio data to generate rich insights, enabling advanced use cases like summarizing entire meetings, combining both visuals and transcribed audio.

## 3. Database Layer

- **SQLite Database**: All captured data is stored in a local SQLite database. This includes audio, video frames, transcriptions, and OCR results. The database is structured into different tables to keep audio transcriptions, frame captures, and OCR texts well-organized.
- **API Access**: Screenpipe provides an API to interact with the stored data. Users can query the database, extract data, and manage content using the API via terminal commands or automated scripts.

## 4. Plugin Management Layer

- **Pipe Store**: The **Pipe Store** acts as a marketplace for plugins (pipes), allowing users to download, install, and share pipes that extend Screenpipe's functionality.
- **Deno Typescript Engine**: Runs custom pipes written in TypeScript directly within the Screenpipe environment. This allows developers to build workflows that process captured data (e.g., custom OCR processing, audio transcription enhancements, etc.).

## 5. Integration Layer

- **Third-Party Services**: Integrates with various AI tools and services like Ollama, OpenAI, and Deepgram for advanced data processing capabilities. This allows Screenpipe to summarize meetings, improve transcriptions, and perform complex language tasks.
- **Custom Storage & Cloud Options**: Supports integrations with cloud storage options (like AWS S3) for larger datasets or enterprise use cases. Users can offload data to external storage for long-term retention or higher capacity.

## 6. Security & Privacy Layer

- **Local Data Storage**: By default, Screenpipe stores all data locally, ensuring that users maintain complete control over their content.
- **Encryption**: Provides encryption features to secure captured data, especially sensitive information from screen captures and audio transcriptions.
- **PII Removal**: Automatically filters personal identifiable information (PII) when processing and storing data, especially in cases where the data might be shared externally.

## 7. Cross-Platform Support

Screenpipe is compatible with macOS, Windows, and Linux. Each platform has native features for optimal performance, such as native OCR integration for macOS and Windows, as well as multi-input device support.

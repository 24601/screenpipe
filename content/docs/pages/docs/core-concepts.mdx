# Core Concepts

<MotionDiv>

Screenpipe revolves around the core idea of data pipelines that process screen and audio capture continuously in the background. Here are the foundational concepts:

## Data Capture

- **Screen Capture**: Screenpipe can capture the screen in real-time, storing it as video frames, which can then be analyzed via Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or other processing tools.
- **Audio Capture**: It records all audio input/output and can transcribe the data using built-in speech-to-text models, like Whisper Distil large v3.
- **24/7 Capture**: Designed for continuous data capture, Screenpipe ensures that every action on your screen and audio from meetings or videos is stored, indexed, and available for later use.

## Data Storage

By default, captured data is stored locally on the userâ€™s machine in a folder such as `~/.screenpipe`. This data can be queried, processed, or deleted at any time using the CLI or desktop app.

## Data Querying

Users can query their captured data using terminal commands. For example, you could fetch screen or mic data from a specific time range (e.g., the last hour) and process it using an AI tool like Ollama to generate summaries or insights.

## Plugins (Pipes)

Screenpipe allows you to write custom pipes (plugins) using JavaScript, which run inside a Deno Typescript engine within the app. This provides flexibility to create workflows that suit your specific needs, like summarizing meetings, automating reports, or integrating the data into other applications (e.g., Notion, CRM systems).

### Example Flow of a Pipe

- **Step 1**: Screenpipe captures screen and audio data.
- **Step 2**: Data is stored locally in the database.
- **Step 3**: A custom pipe fetches the data from the last meeting and sends it to an LLM (like OpenAI) for summarization.
- **Step 4**: The summary is saved or exported to a note-taking app like Notion.

Screenpipe simplifies these operations for users by making pipes and customizations easy to develop and deploy.

## Multimodal Integration

Screenpipe is multimodal, meaning it can handle multiple types of input simultaneously, such as combining audio transcription with screen capture and OCR. This integration allows for richer data pipelines where different types of data can be processed together.

## Local Database

Screenpipe stores all captured data in a local SQLite database, which can be accessed and queried via tools like TablePlus. Each type of data (e.g., audio, frames, OCR transcriptions) is stored in a separate table, making it easy to extract and manipulate specific data for custom use cases.

## Data Ownership

One of the key principles behind Screenpipe is data ownership. All the captured data stays on your local machine unless you explicitly choose to share or process it in the cloud. This ensures maximum privacy and security.

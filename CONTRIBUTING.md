### Rust Styleguide

All Rust code must adhere to [Rust Style Guide](https://github.com/rust-lang/style-team/blob/master/guide/guide.md).

We follow [this](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/project-layout.html) folder structure.

## Additional Notes

### Principles 

- **User fanatic: focus on building what people want and making users happy.**
- Concurrency: channels > mutexes/locks
- Simplicity: avoid premature optimization. less is more. optimise for less code, less files, less dependencies, less complexity.
- Focus: avoid feature creep. focus on the core functionality and build upon it. focus on the user and their needs.
- Use numbers: if you can't measure it, you can't improve it.
- Avoid OOP: prefer functional programming.

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests.

* `bug` - Issues that are bugs.
* `enhancement` - Issues that are feature requests.
* `documentation` - Issues or pull requests related to documentation.
* `good first issue` - Good for newcomers.

## Building

```bash
cargo build --release --features metal # or cuda, depending on your computer's NPU
```

## Running Tests

Before submitting a pull request, run all the tests to ensure nothing has broken:

```bash
cargo test
# on macos you need to set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH for apple native OCR tests to run
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(pwd)/screenpipe-vision/lib cargo test
```


## Other hacks

### Debugging memory errors

```bash
RUSTFLAGS="-Z sanitizer=address" cargo run --bin screenpipe
# or
RUSTFLAGS="-Z sanitizer=leak" cargo run --bin screenpipe
```

For performance monitoring, you can use the following command:

```bash
cargo install cargo-instruments
# tracking leaks over 60 minutes time limit
cargo instruments -t Leaks --bin screenpipe --features metal --time-limit 600000 --open
```

Then open the file in `target/release/instruments` using Xcode -> Open Developer Tool -> Instruments.


### Benchmarks

```
cargo bench
```

### Creating new migrations

```bash
cargo install sqlx-cli
sqlx migrate add <migration_name>
```

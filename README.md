Turn your screen into actions (using LLMs). Inspired by `adept.ai`, `rewind.ai`, `Apple Shortcut`. Rust + WASM.

## Screen to action using LLMs
Here's an example of server-side code written in TypeScript that takes the streamed data from ScreenPipe and uses a Large Language Model like OpenAI's to process text and images for analyzing sales conversations:

```typescript
import { ScreenPipe } from "screenpipe";
import { generateObject } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const screenPipe = new ScreenPipe();

export async function onTick() {
  const data = await screenPipe.tick([1], {frames: 60}); // or screen [1, 2, 3, ...]
  // [{frame: [...], text: [...], metadata: [...]}, ...]

  const { object } = await generateObject({
    model: openai("gpt4-o"),
    schema: z.object({
      leads: z.array(z.object({
        name: z.string(),
        company: z.string(),
        role: z.string(),
        status: z.string(),
        messages: z.array(z.string()),
      }),
    })),
    prompt: "Fill salesforce CRM based on Bob's sales activity (this is what appeared on his screen): " +
     data.map((frame) => frame.text).join("\n"),
  });

  // Add to Salesforce API ...
}
```

## Status 

Alpha: runs on my computer (`Macbook pro m3 32 GB ram`).

- [x] screenshots
- [x] mp4 encoding to disk (30 GB / month)
- [x] sqlite local db
- [x] OCR
- [ ] TS SDK
- [x] audio + stt
- [x] api
- [ ] cloud storage options (s3, pqsql, etc.)
- [ ] cloud computing options
- [ ] fast, optimised
- [ ] bug-free 

## Usage

Keep in mind that it's still experimental.

To try the current version, which capture your screen and extract the text, do:

1. Install [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html).
2. Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/louis030195/screen-pipe
cd screen-pipe
```

3. Run the API (make sure to install [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)):

```bash
# This runs a local SQLite DB + an API + screenshot, ocr, mic, stt, mp4 encoding
cargo build --release
./target/release/pipe

# or only stream audio + speech to text to stdout
./target/release/pipe-audio

# or only stream screenshots + ocr to stdout
./target/release/pipe-vision

# or only record mp4 videos + json containing ocr
./target/release/pipe-video
```

PS: in dev mode it's like 1000x slower (`cargo run --bin screenpipe-server`)

  <summary>Examples to query the API</summary>
  
  ```bash
# 1. Basic search query
curl "http://localhost:3030/search?q=test&limit=5&offset=0"

# 2. Search with content type filter (OCR)
curl "http://localhost:3030/search?q=test&limit=5&offset=0&content_type=ocr"

# 3. Search with content type filter (Audio)
curl "http://localhost:3030/search?q=test&limit=5&offset=0&content_type=audio"

# 4. Search with pagination
curl "http://localhost:3030/search?q=test&limit=10&offset=20"

# 5. Get recent results without date range
curl "http://localhost:3030/recent?limit=5&offset=0"

# 6. Get recent results with date range
curl "http://localhost:3030/recent?limit=5&offset=0&start_date=2024-07-02T14:00:00&end_date=2024-07-02T23:59:59"

# 5 s ago
start_date=$(date -u -v-5S +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S')
end_date=$(date -u +'%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S')
curl "http://localhost:3030/recent?limit=5&offset=0&start_date=$start_date&end_date=$end_date"

# 6. Search with no query (should return all results)
curl "http://localhost:3030/search?limit=5&offset=0"

# 7. Get recent results with pagination
curl "http://localhost:3030/recent?limit=20&offset=40"
  ```

Now pipe this into a LLM to build:
- memory extension apps
- automatic summaries
- automatic action triggers (say every time you see a dog, send a tweet)
- automatic CRM (fill salesforce while you spam ppl on linkedin)

We are working toward [making it easier to try](https://github.com/louis030195/screen-pipe/issues/6), feel free to help!

## Why open source?

Recent breakthroughs in AI have shown that context is the final frontier. AI will soon be able to incorporate the context of an entire human life into its 'prompt', and the technologies that enable this kind of personalisation should be available to all developers to accelerate access to the next stage of our evolution.  

## Principles 

This is a library intended to stick to simple use case:
- record the screen & associated metadata (generated locally or in the cloud) and pipe it somewhere (local, cloud)

Think of this as an API that let's you do this:

```bash
screenpipe | ocr | llm "turn what i see into my CRM" | api "send data to salesforce api"
```

Any interfaces are out of scope and should be built outside this repo, for example:
- UI to search on these files (like rewind)
- UI to spy on your employees
- etc.

Very thankful for https://github.com/jasonjmcghee/xrem which was helpful. Although screenpipe is going in a different direction.
